### Interview Prep for Multi Interaction

# How to run

Before you start, create a <your name>.txt file under Descriptions and put in your question description in there in comments

```bash
  ./pair.sh (insert as many participant names)
```
Head to `questions/` to see .java files created for each person. Edit in the file where your name is matched to. When you want to test run, do `./sol.sh (your name)` to run the file that is corresponding to your name

# After your session

```bash
  ./done.sh (date)
```
to save all questions content to a file under PastQuestions and will remove today's content
